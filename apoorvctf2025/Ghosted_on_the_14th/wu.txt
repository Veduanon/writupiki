    <h1>My Day</h1>
    <p>
      ngl, today was mad chill. i was vibin' to hatsune miku (the girl from
      fortnite) and doin' the lil' nod that chopped chin does. then, i was like,
      "bet, imma cop a crib in egypt," but fr, i forgor what they did for me.
      later, i downloaded minecraft 2 and was like, "hold up, i've played these
      games before." after that, to boost my rizz and grind some social credits,
      i locked in and did 5x30 till i passed out. woke up to see the "o i i a i
      u i" cat in front of me and started questioning my sanity. maybe all those
      insta reels were giving me brainrot, but nah, zucc would only do what's
      best for me. i opened my official hawk tuah phone cover phone and scrolled
      until i was one with zi-gxorm 6873.
